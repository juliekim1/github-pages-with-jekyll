1. Music- I love listening to various genres of music; starting from classical to hip-hop-- I'll listen to them all!
I really like finding good music that not many know about and recommending it to my friends. 
2. Baking- This is definitely a new hobby that I caught on following the pandemic. I look cooking tasty treats for family and friends. 
I love seeing the reactions on their face after they take their first bite!
